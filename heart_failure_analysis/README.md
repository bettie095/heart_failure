# heart_failure
Heart failure is a chronic progressive heart condition in which the heart's muscle is unable to pump enough blood adequately, this inhibits oxygen supply to some tissues/organs.
This project is aimed to analyse the factors associated with heart failure (age distribution, sex, death rates, creatinine and sodium levels and platelets counts) 
Datasets was obtained from kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data
Dataset contained informations from 299 heart failure patients

ABOUT DATA

Anemia: 0 =NO , 1=YES ; Anemia is the deficiency of red blood cells/ haemoglobin.

Serum-creatiine : Level 0.6-1.2mg/dL.

Diabetes : 0=NO ,1=YES.

Ejection_fraction: Is the percentage of blood pumping into the heart. normal is 55% - 70% and above.

High_blood_pressure(HBP) : 0=NO, 1=YES.

Platelets: Platelet is involved in the formation of blood clots. The normal value of thrombocyte in the blood is 150-400 kilo-platelets/mcL

creatinine : Level of Creatine produced from the kidneys in the blood.

Serum_sodium : Level of serum creatinine in the blood. The normal range for sodium in the blood is 135-145 mEq / L. A situation with more than 145 millimoles of sodium in a liter of blood means that the body loses more water than it enters the body.

Sex: 0=FEMALE , 1=MALE ; Gender of patient.

Smoking : 0=NOT SMOKING, 1=SMOKING.

Time : Follow up days of patients.

Death_event: Whether patient died during follow up period.

CONCLUSION

Based on SEX, only 35.1% of the Patients were Female.

From the above histogram, it's clear that most of the heart-patients falls under 60-65 age group and the next place goes to 55-60 age group.**

43.1% patients are anaemic.

41.8% patients have diabetics.

35.1% patients have high blood pressure.

32.1% of patients died during the follow-up period.

The most common abnormality or disease among the heart failure patients is Ejection Fraction and 240 Patients had abnormal Ejection Fraction.

The least common abnormality or disease among the heart failure patients is Abnormal
